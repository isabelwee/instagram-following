# How to use
## Download followers and following list from instagram
Settings -> Accounts Centre -> Your information and permissions -> Export your information
- Create a new export
- Select 'Export to device'
- Customise information and clear all options except 'Followers and following' (under the Connections section)

Configure other options to be
- Date range: All time
- Format: JSON

Enter your email and they'll notify when the export is complete

**Note: the 'All time' option means there might be accounts that you've unfollowed long ago but this is the most effective option since date ranges might not get everyone**
